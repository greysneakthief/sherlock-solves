# sherlock-solves
A personal repository of sherlock solves, utilizing obsidian mardown documents and potentially solve files.

## Info
I've decided to keep a public repository of these for fellow investigators.

For this to work in obsidian, utilize the following community plugins:

- Dataviewer
- Templater

## Roadmap
- Improve template engine for obsidian (currently AI slop).
  - ~~Remove the emojis or replace them with tasteful ones.~~
  - Improve and increase template engine options.
- Include better file references for solves.
- Improve methodology and folder structure for solve storage.
