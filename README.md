# sherlock-solves
A personal repository of sherlock solves, utilizing obsidian mardown documents and potentially solve files (TBD)

## Info
I've decided to keep a public repository of these for fellow investigators.

## Roadmap
- Improve template engine for obsidian (currently AI slop).
  - Remove the emojis or replace them with tasteful ones.   
- Include better file references for solves.
- Improve methodology and folder structure for solve storage.
